# ImHex pattern for Garmin's .fit format

Created this in the process of figuring out how to read and modify .fit files, generated by Xiaomi and uploaded to Strava, in order to add steps info.
The folling unsupported features mainly stem from the fact I have no use for them currently.

Unsupported features:
* Message types apart from FileId, Activity, Session, Lap and Record
* Compressed message headers
* Developer fields
* Custom types (redefinition of local message types)

Might look into them, if asked.
